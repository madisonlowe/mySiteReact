      <h1>About.</h1>
      <h2>
        I’m a full-stack software developer, based in the North of England. I
        like making things and solving problems.

        Having previously studied English Literature, and worked in retail,
        telemarketing and customer service, I decided to pursue a new career
        path. I wanted to be able to work creatively, create robust solutions to
        problems, and engage fresh opportunities for learning and personal
        growth. I’ve always been interested in technology, and knew that
        software development would allow me to do just that.

        I got stuck in, completing the SheCodes Basics Introduction to Coding
        and freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certifications. This led me to
        apply to the School of Code, where I was ultimately selected as one of
        150 students – out of nearly 3000 applicants – to train full-time from
        April through August in software development.
