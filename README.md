# Building My Website 2.0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

This is a repo tracking the rebuild process for my personal website. Originally build using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript in [this repo here](https://github.com/madisonlowe/mySiteVanilla), I decided to rebuild the site in React - with some changes along the way - so that I could get some more practice in with React.

The site is still currently a work-in-progress.
