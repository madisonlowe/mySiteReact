            I’m a full-stack software developer, based in the North of England.
            I like making things and solving problems.

            Having previously worked in retail, telemarketing and customer
            service, after completing my Literature MSc during the Covid-19
            lockdowns, I decided to expand my horizons and try something new. I
            wanted to be able to work creatively and productively while engaging
            fresh opportunities for learning and personal growth. I knew that
            programming would allow me to do just that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got started by completing the SheCodes Basics{" "}
            <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/certificates/3406255c971ef3077b043a898fd80aed">
              Introduction to Coding
            </a>{" "}
            and freeCodeCamp’s{" "}
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/saelida/responsive-web-design">
              Responsive Web Design
            </a>{" "}
            certifications in Spring 2022. This led me to the School of Code,
            where I was selected as one of 150 bootcampers – out of nearly 3000
            applicants – to train full-time from April through August in
            software development.
