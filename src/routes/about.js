            I’m a full-stack software developer, based in the North of England.
            I like making things and solving problems.

            Having previously studied English Literature, and worked in retail,
            telemarketing and customer service, I decided to pursue a new career
            path. I wanted to be able to work creatively and productively,
            engaging fresh opportunities for learning and personal growth. I’ve
            always been interested in technology, and knew that software
            development would allow me to do just that.

            I got stuck in, completing the SheCodes Basics Introduction to
            Coding and freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certifications in
            Spring 2022. This led me to the School of Code, where I was selected
            as one of 150 bootcampers – out of nearly 3000 applicants – to train
            full-time from April through August in software development.
